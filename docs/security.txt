AI GAMING AGENT - Security Guide
==================================

SECURITY LAYERS
---------------
The system implements multiple security measures:

  1. Password/Token Authentication
     - Required for all connections
     - Validated on every request

  2. Path Restrictions
     - File access limited to allowed directories
     - Prevents access to system files

  3. Command Blocklist
     - Dangerous commands are blocked
     - Prevents system damage

  4. Rate Limiting
     - Maximum requests per minute
     - Prevents abuse

  5. Audit Logging
     - All actions logged with timestamps
     - Enables review and forensics

  6. TLS/HTTPS (Optional)
     - Encrypts all traffic
     - Recommended for production


AUTHENTICATION FLOW
-------------------
  1. Client sends HTTP request with Authorization header
  2. Header format: "Bearer <password>"
  3. Server validates password against config
  4. If valid: establish SSE connection
  5. If invalid: return 401 Unauthorized


BEST PRACTICES - DO
-------------------
  - Use strong, unique passwords (16+ characters)
  - Use different passwords for each PC
  - Limit file access to game directories only
  - Use VPN when accessing over internet
  - Enable TLS/HTTPS for production
  - Rotate passwords regularly
  - Review audit logs periodically
  - Keep software updated


BEST PRACTICES - DON'T
----------------------
  - Expose port directly to internet without VPN
  - Use simple or default passwords
  - Allow unrestricted command execution
  - Give access to system directories
  - Run server as root/admin unless required
  - Share passwords across multiple systems
  - Ignore authentication failures in logs


NETWORK SECURITY
----------------

Local Network Only (Recommended for beginners):
  - Bind to local IP only
  - Use network firewall
  - No internet exposure

VPN Access (Recommended for remote):
  - Use WireGuard, OpenVPN, or Tailscale
  - Gaming PCs only accessible via VPN
  - Full encryption of traffic

Direct Internet (Not Recommended):
  - Requires TLS/HTTPS
  - Strong password essential
  - Consider IP allowlisting
  - Monitor for attacks


COMMAND EXECUTION SAFETY
------------------------
The execute_command tool is powerful but dangerous.

Recommended blocked commands:
  - rm -rf, del /f (destructive deletion)
  - format (disk formatting)
  - shutdown, reboot (system control)
  - chmod 777, icacls (permission changes)
  - curl | bash (remote code execution)

Set reasonable timeout limits (30 seconds default).


FILE ACCESS SAFETY
------------------
Limit allowed_paths to:
  - Game installation directory
  - Game save/data directory
  - Temporary screenshot folder

Never allow:
  - System directories (Windows, System32, /etc)
  - User profile root
  - Password/credential storage locations


LOGGING AND MONITORING
----------------------
Log files are stored in ~/.gaming-agent/logs/

  server.log  - Server events and connections
  actions.log - All tool executions
  errors.log  - Error events

Review logs regularly for:
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Unusual command patterns
  - Unexpected file access
  - High request rates


INCIDENT RESPONSE
-----------------
If you suspect unauthorized access:

  1. Stop the MCP server immediately
  2. Change passwords
  3. Review audit logs
  4. Check for unauthorized file changes
  5. Restart with new configuration
  6. Consider additional security measures
