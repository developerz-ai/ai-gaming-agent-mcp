COMMUNICATION FLOW
------------------

  1. Master Claude sends tool call request
  2. MCP Server receives and validates request
  3. Server executes action (screenshot, click, etc)
  4. Server returns result to Claude
  5. Claude analyzes result and plans next action


MCP PROTOCOL OVERVIEW
---------------------
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol by Anthropic that
standardizes how AI applications connect to external tools. Think of
it as a universal interface for AI tool integration.

Key Components:
  Host      - The AI application coordinating everything
  Client    - Manages connection to one MCP Server
  Server    - Exposes tools, resources, and prompts
  Transport - Message delivery: stdio (local) or HTTP/SSE (remote)


ARCHITECTURE OPTIONS
--------------------

Option A: Claude Does All Vision (Simplest)
  - Master Claude analyzes all screenshots
  - Gaming PCs are simple executors
  - No GPU needed on gaming PCs
  - Higher latency due to image upload
  - Best intelligence (Claude is smarter)

Option B: Hybrid (Local VLM for Speed)
  - Master Claude handles high-level decisions
  - Local VLM handles fast visual processing
  - Lower API costs
  - Requires GPU on gaming PCs
  - Good balance of speed and intelligence

Option C: Full Local (Maximum Privacy)
  - Local orchestrator (e.g., Qwen3-72B)
  - Local VLMs on gaming PCs
  - No API costs
  - Complete privacy
  - Requires powerful hardware


RECOMMENDED APPROACH
--------------------
Start with Option A for simplicity. Move to Option B if you need
faster response times or want to reduce API costs. Option C is for
users who require complete offline operation.
