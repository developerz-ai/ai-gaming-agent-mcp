AI GAMING AGENT - Project Overview
===================================

Project Name: ai-gaming-agent

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
AI Gaming Agent is a distributed automation system where a Master Claude
orchestrator controls multiple remote gaming PCs through MCP (Model Context
Protocol) servers. Each PC runs a local vision model and PyAutoGUI to
execute game actions autonomously.

The system enables simultaneous game account leveling across different
machines with intelligent decision-making and progress monitoring.


PRIMARY USE CASE
----------------
Automated game leveling across multiple accounts and machines:

  - Master Claude connects to multiple gaming PCs
  - Each PC runs an MCP server exposing control tools
  - Claude analyzes game screens and decides actions
  - Actions execute via PyAutoGUI on each PC
  - Progress is monitored and reported automatically


KEY CAPABILITIES
----------------
  1. Multi-PC orchestration from single Claude instance
  2. Real-time screenshot capture and analysis
  3. Mouse and keyboard automation
  4. File system access for game data
  5. Optional local vision models for faster processing
  6. Progress tracking and reporting


SYSTEM COMPONENTS
-----------------
  Master Claude
    - High-level strategy and planning
    - Decides what actions to take
    - Monitors progress across all PCs
