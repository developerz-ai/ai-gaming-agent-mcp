AI GAMING AGENT - Workflow Guide
==================================

MASTER CLAUDE WORKFLOW
----------------------

Step 1: Initialize Connections
  Master Claude connects to all configured MCP servers
  Example connections:
    - PC1 (192.168.1.10:8765) - Account: PlayerOne
    - PC2 (192.168.1.11:8765) - Account: PlayerTwo
    - PC3 (192.168.1.12:8765) - Account: PlayerThree

Step 2: Check Current State (Parallel)
  For each PC, Claude requests:
    - Screenshot of current game screen
    - Optional: analyze_screen for quick status

  Results might show:
    - PC1: Level 15, doing quest "Dragon Slayer"
    - PC2: Level 8, idle in town
    - PC3: Level 22, in combat

Step 3: Generate Instructions
  Claude analyzes all states and decides actions:
    - PC1: Continue quest, navigate to next objective
    - PC2: Accept quest from NPC, start leveling
    - PC3: Execute combat rotation

Step 4: Execute Actions
  Claude sends tool calls to each PC:
    - PC1: click, move_to, click sequence
    - PC2: click on NPC, type dialog option, press enter
    - PC3: hotkey sequence for skills

Step 5: Verify and Loop
  After actions complete:
    - Take new screenshots
    - Check if actions succeeded
    - If failed: retry with different approach
    - If succeeded: continue to next action

Step 6: Report Progress
  Periodically generate status reports:
    - Levels gained per account
    - Quests completed
    - Resources collected
    - Time elapsed


SINGLE PC ACTION SEQUENCE
-------------------------

  User Request: "Level up the account on PC1"

  Claude Actions:
    1. Call screenshot on PC1
       -> Receives game screen image

    2. Analyze screenshot
       -> Identifies: Menu open, "Play" button visible

    3. Call click on Play button coordinates
       -> Returns success

    4. Wait for game to load (2 seconds)

    5. Call screenshot again
       -> Now shows in-game view

    6. Analyze new screenshot
       -> Character at level 15, enemy visible

    7. Decide: Attack enemy for XP

    8. Call click on enemy position
       -> Targets enemy

    9. Call press_key for attack skill
       -> Executes attack

   10. Loop steps 5-9 until level up detected

   11. Report: "Gained 1 level on PC1, now level 16"


PARALLEL OPERATION
------------------
Claude can manage multiple PCs simultaneously:

  1. Send screenshot requests to all PCs in parallel
  2. Analyze all screenshots
  3. Generate action plan for each PC
  4. Execute actions on all PCs (can be parallel)
  5. Verify results on all PCs
  6. Repeat


ERROR HANDLING
--------------
When actions fail:

  1. Take new screenshot to see current state
  2. Identify what went wrong
  3. Try alternative approach
  4. If repeated failures: pause and report to user

Common recovery strategies:
  - Click slightly different coordinates
  - Wait longer between actions
  - Use keyboard instead of mouse
  - Restart from known good state


PROGRESS TRACKING
-----------------
Claude can track metrics over time:

  - Starting level vs current level
  - Quests started vs completed
  - Gold/currency earned
  - Items collected
  - Time spent per level
  - Actions per minute


EXAMPLE SESSION
---------------

User: "Level up accounts on PC1 and PC2 to level 20"

Claude Response:
  "Checking current status of both PCs...

   PC1 (Game X): Level 12, in starter zone
   PC2 (Game X): Level 7, at login screen

   PC2 needs to log in first. Handling that now...
   [Executes login sequence on PC2]

   PC1 - Moving to better XP zone...
   [Navigates PC1 to quest area]

   Continuing to monitor. Will report progress every 10 minutes."

[10 minutes later]

  "Progress Update:
   - PC1: Level 12 -> 14 (+2 levels), completed 2 quests
   - PC2: Level 7 -> 11 (+4 levels), finished tutorial

   Continuing toward level 20 goal..."


STOPPING AUTOMATION

  - User can request Claude to pause
  - Claude will complete current action then wait
  - Can resume from paused state
  - Emergency: directly stop MCP server on gaming PC
